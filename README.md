# kicad-lib #

A collection of open source kicad libaries and schematics

### What is this repository for? ###

Time after time I find myself creating the same circuits
or looking for the same libraries. This repository is meant
to alleviate that. It contains, in some cases, mirrors
of other libraries for convenience, and in others, custom
schematics to provide a starting place for designs.

### How is this licensed? ###

Mirrored libraries are each subject to their own upstream license.
Some effort has been made to consolidate these in licenses.txt

All other content is released under a MIT license.
